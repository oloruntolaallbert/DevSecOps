I had a bit of difficulty to get to the browser 

here are some tips 

My minikube is using Docker Engine.  The thing I had to do was add 127.0.0.1 mysite.local to the /etc/hosts file.
  Do not use the IP given by get ingress. 
Don't know if it is due to a new version of Minikube, but in order for the browser to work, I had to run minikube tunnel and once that was running I was able to get it in the browser
change the ingress.yaml file and replace the host with demo.localdev.me

or 
Run the following command
kubectl port-forward service/websrvc 8080:8080
the solution i did was to run this cmd after creating the ingress : 
or
kubectl port-forward --namespace=ingress-nginx service/ingress-nginx-controller 80:80

This cmd allow to listen on port 8080 locally and forward the request to port 80 in the pod.

(I found this cmd here : https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/#quick-start)
