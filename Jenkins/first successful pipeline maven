//ran into a bit of difficulty and attached is a screenshot of my progress

// if you run into issue when running build ( Rule 0: org.apache.maven.plugins.enforcer.RequireMavenVersion failed with message:Detected Maven Version: 3.6.3 is not in the allowed range [3.8.6,).)
// 1) fork devsecops-jenkins into your own Github repo
// 2) edit the POM.XML and set the 3.8.8 to 3.6.3 for the Maven Version in your forked repo
//3) Ensure you clone your git repo in thr "clone Repo" stage also don't forget to change the dir if it's cloned to a specific folder/directory
